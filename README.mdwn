# debian-reproducible-helper

This is a set of scripts which I've been using to automatically reproduce the results of [[https://reproducible.debian.net/]]. The goal is to see if I can build bit-for-bit copies of Debian's packages.


1) Install pbuilder. For this to work, I've found that version 0.219 of pbuilder is required, which is available in debian unstable (at the time of writing)
1) Copy pbuilderrc to /root/.pbuilderrc.
2) sudo ./packagebuilder <package name>

For the package name, use one of the packages listed at https://reproducible.debian.net/unstable/amd64/index_all_abc.html (preferably, one of the ones that is marked as reproducible)
